As you can see from the generated HTML above, there's a "v" parameter in the file's URL. All CSS and Javascript files included with
<o2 docLink type="tag" id="addCssFile" /> or <o2 docLink type="tag" id="addJsFile" /> (or automatically included with a tag or tag lib) get
this "v" parameter, which is the version of the repository where the file resides. So the version number will be different depending on
whether the CSS/Javascript file is located in O2 Framework, O2 CMS or in customer code. The "v" parameter is intended to make sure the
browser discards its cached version of the CSS/Javascript file when the file is changed on disk. The config file version.conf contains the
version number.
