  "What is this?" you may think, "why can't I just open my tags the regular way?" And, of course, that's what you should
  do in more than 99.9% of all cases. However, in a few special situations you may need to open and close tags in the wrong order.
  It could be a foreach loop that for some reason first closes a td-tag and then opens a new one. That would mess up your indentation,
  and O2::Template::Critic would complain. To keep the document clean, use this tag and <o2 docLink type="tag" id="closingTag" />
  instead of opening and closing the td tags the normal way. Avoid writing tags in the wrong order if you can, but if you can't,
  here's your backup solution.
