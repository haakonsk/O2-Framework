To run tests one by one:
  /o2cms/Test-Js/?file=<filename>
Example:
  /o2cms/Test-Js/?file=base.t
where base.t.js resides in $ENV{O2ROOT}/var/www/js/t or $ENV{CUSTOMERROOT}/var/www/js/t.

To run all tests:
  /o2cms/Test-Js/harness

Use the template below as a starting point for your test script.
Warning: It's important to avoid naming conflicts in the global namespace.
That's why I suggest encapsulating the functions in a hash/object as shown below.

The test script shouldn't start running the tests itself, it should just tell "tester"
which method must be invoked in order for the tests to start running. Do that with
tester.setStartMethod(). The argument is a function reference.



require("/js/<nameOfJsFileToTest>.js");

var <nameOfJsFileToTest> = {
  runTests : function() {
    // Perform tests here
  }
};

tester.setStartMethod(<nameOfJsFileToTest>.runTests);
